This is a very useful tip I shared a while ago at the office and turned out to be extremely useful.<br><br>If you work with java and use eclipse as an IDE you know that eclipse has something called WTP, which stands for Web Tools Platform. It's a set of tools and API's to aid in the development of web and JEE projects.<br><br>That means that if you have a WTP project in your workspace, you can deploy, run and debug it straight from the IDE. But what happens if your project is not of a WTP nature?<br><br>Back at the office we have a coupe of really old Java project. WTP didn't exist back then but we do use Eclipse as our IDE of choice.<br><br>So, how do we debug a deployed project that we don't actually deploy from the IDE? As long as you have the source, it is quite simple:<!--more--><br><br>First you need to add a new server form the Server window, if you don't have one already:<br><br><a href="<%= img_path('/assets/images/add_server/') %>"><img class="size-medium wp-image-92" title="add_server" src="<%= img_path('/assets/images/add_server-275x300/') %>" alt="Add server wizard" width="275" height="300" /></a><br><br>After that, double click the server to open its configuration window:<br><br><a href="<%= img_path('/assets/images/server_config/') %>"><img class="size-medium wp-image-93" title="server_config" src="<%= img_path('/assets/images/server_config-300x203/') %>" alt="Tomcat server overview" width="300" height="203" /></a><br><br>Now, in the Geneneral information section click Open Launch configuration and select the Source tab:<br><br><a href="<%= img_path('/assets/images/launch_config/') %>"><img class="size-medium wp-image-94" title="launch_config" src="<%= img_path('/assets/images/launch_config-300x239/') %>" alt="Launch Configuration" width="300" height="239" /></a><br><br>From this window you can add the sources of the project you want to debug. Once done, just drop a breakpoint in your source file and start your server in debug mode.<br><br>You're good to go!
