<strong>- Overall results</strong><br><br>First off, I'd like to thank everyone who voted on this poll.<br>With a total of 236 votes, here is the summary of the first two questions:<br><br><strong>- Are you currently working with or researching about language alternatives for the JVM? - e.g. JRuby, Scala, Groovy</strong><br><br>[caption id="attachment_267" align="alignnone" width="450" caption="Level of interest on JVM language alternatives"]<a href="http://www.leonardoborges.com/writings/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/image.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-267" title="Level of interest on JVM language alternatives" src="http://www.leonardoborges.com/writings/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/image.png" alt="Level of interest on JVM language alternatives" width="450" height="320" /></a>[/caption]<br><br><strong>- If you answered yes or maybe to the previous question, what alternative would that be?</strong><br><br>[caption id="attachment_268" align="alignnone" width="450" caption="JVM language alternatives preference"]<a href="http://www.leonardoborges.com/writings/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/image2.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-268" title="JVM language alternatives preference" src="http://www.leonardoborges.com/writings/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/image2.png" alt="JVM language alternatives preference" width="450" height="320" /></a>[/caption]<br><br>As you can see, the vast majority of Java developers that participated on this poll have interest or are working with a language other than Java for the JVM. The results of the second chart were surprising for me and we have <a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/" target="_blank">Groovy</a> standing really tall with an astonishing 101 votes, followed by <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/" target="_blank">Scala</a> and <a href="http://jruby.codehaus.org/" target="_blank">JRuby</a> in a tougher competition.<br><br>The poll also consisted of 2 other questions, both free text, and I tried to analyze them in more detail to understand the "why's" and "how's" of these results.<br><br>Keep reading for the detailed summary...<br><br><!--more--><br><br>I've split the results according to the choices and analyzed them individually using a tag cloud. This allowed me to filter some common words and hopefully focus on the important bits of the comments. They are displayed grouped by choice and question.<br><br><strong>- Groovy</strong><br><br><em>Please provide a brief summary to back up your choice</em><br><br><a href="http://www.leonardoborges.com/writings/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/groovy_likes.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-266 alignnone" title="Why choose groovy" src="http://www.leonardoborges.com/writings/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/groovy_likes.jpg" alt="Why choose groovy" width="501" height="328" /></a><br><br>The general feeling here is that people find Groovy a language easy to move to, being a java developer. Most of the answers also highlights the Groovy integration with java. Things like "change from .java to .groovy and start from there".<br><br>Another aspect was the community, which is vast and supportive. A good amount of the answers also mentioned Scala as being too complex and academic.<br><br><em>Is there anything that would make any of these alternatives more attractive to you?</em><br><br><a href="http://www.leonardoborges.com/writings/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/groovy_improvements.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-265" title="What could be improved?" src="http://www.leonardoborges.com/writings/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/groovy_improvements.jpg" alt="What could be improved?" width="502" height="328" /></a><br><br>Most people said that JRuby would be their second choice if they saw more improvements on the Java integration and performance. Scala also got mentions about - again - its complexity and a few asking for improvement in documentation. Both JRuby and Scala got negative comments regarding their syntax.<br><br><strong>- JRuby</strong><br><br><em>Please provide a brief summary to back up your choice</em><br><br><a href="http://www.leonardoborges.com/writings/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/jruby_likes.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-264" title="jruby_likes" src="http://www.leonardoborges.com/writings/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/jruby_likes.jpg" alt="jruby_likes" width="502" height="327" /></a><br><br>As one might guess, many people mentioned the ability to use Rails - thus leveraging their existing Ruby knowledge - as a big win for JRuby. Also, kudos for the community for being supportive and friendly. Several comments about it.<br><br><em>Is there anything that would make any of these alternatives more attractive to you?</em><br><br><a href="http://www.leonardoborges.com/writings/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/jruby_improvements.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-263" title="jruby_improvements" src="http://www.leonardoborges.com/writings/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/jruby_improvements.jpg" alt="jruby_improvements" width="501" height="327" /></a><br><br>Many wishes towards JRuby's Java integration and support. More specific comments of compiling ruby classes into java classes and so on...<br><br><strong>-Scala</strong><br><br><em>Please provide a brief summary to back up your choice</em><br><br><strong><a href="http://www.leonardoborges.com/writings/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/scala_likes.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-262" title="scala_likes" src="http://www.leonardoborges.com/writings/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/scala_likes.png" alt="scala_likes" width="501" height="327" /></a></strong><br><br>Clearly Scala's type system and functional programming features were highlighted the most. As a general feeling, people who chose Scala would have chosen Groovy as a second best.<br><br><em>Is there anything that would make any of these alternatives more attractive to you?</em><br><br><em><a href="http://www.leonardoborges.com/writings/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/scala_improvements.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-261" title="scala_improvements" src="http://www.leonardoborges.com/writings/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/scala_improvements.png" alt="scala_improvements" width="500" height="327" /></a></em><br><br>Tooling. The majority of comment urge for better tooling and IDE support. That simple.<br><br><strong>- Others</strong><br><br>People who chose others mentioned <a href="http://clojure.org/" target="_blank">Clojure</a>, <a href="http://www.fandev.org/" target="_blank">Fan</a> and <a href="http://www.jython.org/">Jython</a>, with a clear advantage for Clojure.<br><br><strong>- Disclaimer</strong><br><br><strong>This poll has no scientific foundations whatsoever and its sole purpose is to summarize the feelings and personal choices of the people who answered it. If you would like the original spreadsheet with the answers, you can find it <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AuABB6DyTXV2dHEtZnNwSDhCb2RVOThFcUNaSUhpbEE&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">here</a> and do your own analyzis.<br></strong>
